    <p>
      The croissant is thought to have originated in Austria as the kipferl, a
      crescent-shaped pastry made from yeasted wheat dough. The kipferl has been
      around since at least the 13th century, and is denser and sweeter than the
      modern croissant, which is made from yeasted puff pastry dough and butter.
